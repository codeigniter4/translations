This project contains translations for CodeIgniter 4 localization, *i.e.,* **system/Language/en/**.

Copy the folder(s) for the locales you are interested in, from inside the **Language** folder of
this project to your **app/Language/** folder.

You may then use the CodeIgniter Language class to reference the translations
directly. See the [User Guide](https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/outgoing/localization.html).

Localization in CodeIgniter 4 follows the
[ISO 639-1 conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Each translation set
would go inside a folder named following the two-letter language code from here.

Localization variants are provided for, as folders named with the two-letter ISO 639-1 language code in
lowercase, followed by the two-letter [ISO 3166 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
capitalized, and with the two parts separated by a hyphen.

An example would be "en" for English, and "en-US" for the variations appropriate to the United States.

## Repository Information

Each ICU locale is maintained by a community member, per the table below. The role of maintainers is to
provide a single authority for vetting translations for a given language, since the framework team
claims no expertise beyond English.
