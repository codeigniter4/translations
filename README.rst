Translations for CodeIgniter 4 System Messages
##############################################

This project contains translations for CodeIgniter 4
localization, eg. **system/Language/en**.

Copy the folder(s) for the locales you are interested in,
from inside the **Language** folder of this project to your
**application/Language** folder.

You may then use the CodeIgniter Language class to reference the translations
directly ... see the `User Guide <https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/outgoing/localization.html>`_.

Localization in CodeIgniter 4 follows the `ISO 639-1 conventions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_.
Each translation set would go inside a folder named following the two-letter language code from here.

Localization variants are provided for, as folders named with the two-letter ISO 639-1 language code in lowercase, 
followed by the two-letter `ISO 3166 country code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`_ capitalized, 
and with the two parts separated by a hyphen. 
An example would be "en" for English, and "en-US" for the variations appropriate to the United States.

Each language is maintained by a community member, per the table below.
The role of maintainers is to provide a single authority for vetting
translations for a given language, since the framework team claims no
expertise beyond English.
